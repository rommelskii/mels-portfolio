PROJECT: Automatic Question Generation (Undergraduate Research)\n------------------------------------------------\n> "Automatic Question Generation from Handwritten Lecture Notes"\n> Tech: TrOCR, T5, Raspberry Pi 5, Python, PyTorch, Angular/Flask.\n> Award: People's Choice & 1st Runner Up (Best Presenter)\n> Source: 10.1109/ICCAE64891.2025.10980579\n\nWHAT I LEARNED:\nResearch writing (LaTeX), documentations, Python AI/ML development, optical character recognition, Angular front-end development, edge device deployment (Raspberry Pi), Linux BASH scripting and crontab scheduling (debian), project presentation\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nMy undergraduate thesis revolves around the premise of generating quiz materials out of handwritten notes of students. It serves as one of the solutions to the Philippines' problem of primary and secondary school students not having access to learning materials.\n\nThe device consists of a hollow wooden box with internal lighting that takes in letter-sized plainsheetpaper that contains the handwritten notes that are captured with an internal web camera. Provided on the front of the device is a 7-inch touchscreen display that shows the system's user interface. The user interface shows a live camera feed for the positioning of the paper, and controls for performing text extraction and processing.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-----------------+\n| Image acquisition | ---> |  Text extraction  | ---> | Quiz Generation |\n|     (OpenCV)      |      | (Microsoft TrOCR) |      |   (Google T5)   |\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-----------------+\n\nThe system consists of three processing stages. The first stage (image acquisition) involves the image capture and conditioning of the handwritten notes in preparation for text extraction. The second stage involves the use of Microsoft's TrOCR model for extracting keywords. The last stage of processing involves the indexing of keywords that will be used for prompts to be fed into Google's Text-to-Text transformer (T5) that generates the quiz questions which are formatted into a PDF.\n\nWith regards to quiz generation, the T5 model used was fine-tuned to the Stanford Question-Answering Database (SQuAD) to generate questions from a prompt that utilizes a keyword and the original text.\n

Involves system design and implementation (PCB design) of kiosk-like ordering interface connected to an owner-facing interface that tracks pending orders while also providing insights for the remaining ingredients and drinks that can be made.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n+------------------+     +----------------------+     +---------------+\n|                  |---->|ORDER STRUCTURING UNIT|<--->|OWNER INTERFACE|\n|                  |     +----------------------+     +---------------+\n|                  |                 |\n|CUSTOMER INTERFACE|                 |\n|                  |                 |\n|                  |                 V\n|                  |     +-----------------------+\n|                  |<----|MENU DISPLAY INDICATORS|\n+------------------+     +-----------------------+\n\nTHE ORDER BITSTRING:\nThe scope of this project covers milk tea beverages that consist of the following parameters:\n> Size (small or medium)\n> Add-on (4 types)\n> Amount (1-9)\n> Flavor (11 flavors)\n\nBased on the number of possibilities per parameter, we constructed the order bitstring:\n+----------+---------------+--------------------+--------------+\n|   Size   |    Add-ons    |       Amount       |    Flavor    |\n|  (1 bit) |    (2 bits)   |      (4 bits)      |   (2 bits)   |\n+----------+---------------+--------------------+--------------+\n\nCUSTOMER INTERFACE:\nEach of the parameter values in the bitstring are mapped to a specific type. The order bitstring parameters are controlled by the customer through the customer interface. The customer interface consists of a 11-button keypad that allows for the selection of the flavor. Provided too are the up/down controls for selecting or cycling through the possible add-ons, size, and amount.\n\nMENU DISPLAY INDICATORS:\nHow can the customer keep track of the parameters that they chosen on the customer interface? To solve this problem, we provided individual LEDs and a single 7-segment digit display (amount) for showing the choices they selected on the interface. This subsystem is simply a combinational circuit that uses the parameters chosen by the user from the customer interface and lights a specific LED for their choice. This was done via a design of an 8-to-11 decoder and a couple of 2-to-4 decoders.\n\nORDER STRUCTURING UNIT:\nFor grouping the order information into the bitstring we have defined, the order structuring unit collects the data from the customer interface, buffers it, and structures the order bitstring in two 8-bit parallel-in serial-out (PISO) Motorola 74LS166 shift registers. For sending the order to the owner interface for parsing, inventory logistics, and tracking, we transferred the bitstring serially where the clock input was derived from the ATmega328P using one of the digital I/O pins.\n\nCUSTOMER INTERFACE:\nThe customer interface houses the ATmega328P. Provided also are two 20 column by 4 row LCDs that show the pending orders in one LCD, and the ingredient stocks available on the other. The customer can choose to acknowledge or deny the order provided by the customer. They can also see how many drinks they can make for the specific order based on the flavor and size.\n\nThe ingredient stocks are stored in the EEPROM, so hard resets do not wipe the stock. The system has a real-time clock module that resets the ingredients to default every Sunday 12:00AM. This matched the actual behavior of the client when restocking.

PROJECT: Otter Protocol (Personal)\n------------------------------------------------\n> TCP client/server protocol from scratch.\n> Written in C (1999 standard) with only standard socket libraries.\n> I intend this project to be open-source\n> Source: github.com/rommelskii/otter\n\nWHAT I LEARNED:\nTCP/IP socket programming, unit testing, data serialization/deserialization, memory allocation safety, and basic public-key cryptography.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThis project involves the design and implementation of a protocol between a client and server for authenticating users via usernames and passwords that are cross-checked with the serverside database.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\nThis protocol revolves around an 'Otter server' or 'otserver', and one or more 'Otter clients' or 'otclient'. An otclient may refer to any service that utilizes the Otter Protocol API for constructing packets to be sent to the otserver for authenticating user details. On the other hand, an otserver has access to a database of existing credentials that is used for authenticating inbound usernames and passwords in the form of a hash digest.\n\nOtter servers have access to username-password combinations in an 'Otter file' or 'otfile' for short. Each otfile entry is tokenized and converted into a salted hash digest. Collectively, the otfile is transformed into memory as a hash table for authentication. For an otclient to authenticate user details with a known otserver database, they must first tether to the otserver via TREQ/TACK handshake. Otclients send a tether request (TREQ) packet to the otserver to initialize tethering. If an otserver accepts the otclient, it replies with a tether acknowledge (TACK)\n\nUser authentication in this protocol is just the lookup of an inbound hash digest in the existing server database. If a user exists, the server sends a credential valid (CVAL) back to the client that it exists. Otherwise, it sends a credential invalid (CINV) reply back to the server. The protocol suite can be extended to involve user authorization by adding extra details alongside the user credentials that define the privileges of a user.\n
